Hey there.

As a CS graduate currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech, my primary objective is to help your business **make data profitable**. My skill set spans across _Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, and ML Engineering_. This is where I showcase [my projects](https://raashidsalih.github.io/projects/) and share what I find useful along the way via [the occasional blog post](https://raashidsalih.github.io/posts/). Feel free to look around, or [click here to learn more about me](https://raashidsalih.github.io/about/).
