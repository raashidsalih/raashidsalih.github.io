Hey there.
{{< /lead >}}

As a CS graduate currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech, my primary objective is to help your business **make data profitable**. My skill set spans across _Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, and ML Engineering_. If you are seeking a dedicated and results-driven professional who can turn your organization's data into a strategic asset, let's connect.

I intend to achieve said objective in a number of ways:
- By developing and maintaining the infrastructure (cloud or otherwise) to make data readily available to the departments that require it for analysis.
- By preparing more robust pipelines that facilitate consistent reporting for upper management decision making.
- Finally, I can create and maintain Machine Learning models that enable departments to make better decisions and operate with more efficiency.

I am rather passionate about the applied data space, especially how modelling and analytics can have a tangible impact to a company's operations beyond just a proof of concept.
